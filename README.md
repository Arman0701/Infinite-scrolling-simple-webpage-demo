## Infinte scrolling demo

### This is a simple application for demonstrating infinite scrolling feature.
### I'm using jsonplaceholder service api for getting data. As you can see there is some initial data when webpage is already loaded. 
### After that when user scrolls to bottom, page was sending a new request to server for getting new data.
### This app is adaptive for mobile phones and tablets.
